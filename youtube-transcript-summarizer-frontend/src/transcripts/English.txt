At starting you may feel like you this things, but after 2 to 4 videos i'll progress it slowly to advance level. I'll point out such thing and i'll take you further. In this course i'll completely explain html, css and javascript. And further i'll explain you how to make a successful website. And i'll tell you all how you don't need to face this type of problem in life. This course is for that people only, i teach end to end from starting. There you'll get some best practices, common mistakes which people should use. Before starting this video, i want to request you all to like this video. Firstly we'll discuss how a website works. We'll see the analogy of car. This course is for people who does not know any thing. When you join this course, let me know by writing. So i'll explain this thing very soon. Sometimes you want 4 elements in a row, but the 4th and 5th element are going down It says that give me codewithharrycom now its like, codewithharrycom is on server of codewithharry or any website, as googlecom is kept in the server of google, which has its own ip address. If i write codewithharrycom/contact than it may happen that i get some another page. That response is given by your server, that take this 3 things. And on this ip address, this website is standing here, its files and backend are kept. But if you have asked for aloo-gobi , then you would have got something else and not paneer butter masala. Likewise you write codewithharrycom than home page will come. I am writing decers here, which means things has been added to make it look more beautiful. These all things tells a website that, how it should work. So it may happen that i get some another page. I am doing request from the website codewithharrycom. In the same way, html is the metallic body in the website. So this response has been given by your web server. Suppose you go to a restuarant and ask to get any food dish. And along with that, the design made in the wheel and the added external metal, alloy wheels and all that. Here i want to let you know, how a website works. So what the client did, in his ubuntu or windows or any operating system, in that computer he sent a request. Request will look something like this, wwwcodewithharrycom. And you ask for roti, which also you get, and it comes to your table. Its body is html, and css and javascript are somewhere in the body only. Response is, this is your paneer butter masala and have it. So he may get any default dish, which he serves. If you put /contact , than contact page will come. This is a web server and a computer. And there you ask for paneer butter masala. If you put /about , than about page will come So i hope you understand how this website works i will explain again quickly here was a computer here is client, that computer owner, he said codewithharrycom request went to codewithharrycom server server did processing in my case i am using python on my server so processing happened through python which generate 3 things html css and javascript where css and javascript were present inside html and came back to this computer now when this computer will receive html css and javascript. And whoever built browser will display that only so, made standard this is a well standardized system and as i said there is a body of website this is a standard markup language which means everyone will use it only no one can introduce its own new language and the web browsers too have to adapt with this only now here html is only body means face if talk about human then only skeleton with bones. So in this way client and server communicate with each other client sends request to server and server does processing using  any of this programming language/backend prepare to send front end to client so backend prepare these 3 things html css and javascript and it sends this thing to them. So the cascading style sheet, is a stylesheet language which give good presentation to the web page or html body which element should have which colour, background colour which element should float left which element would go on top which element will keep how much margin inside it how much padding, what will be its border color all this thing is decided by css. What is web browser does is the document we received which is html css javascript text by manipulating the document it shows you what you see if you open codewithharrycom you will see a website in which there will be images, where what will come to display that after manipulating is work of browser and what does browser receive?. And then we will start coding let's talk about html which stands for hypertext markup language and this is a standard means many people agreed that we will use html to make websites everyone use that only. Like a human is taking wise decisions then it can take wise decisions with the help of javascript only suppose a person saying let's go there means he can think means he is javascript. So if we talk about skeleton, my drawing is not so good but just think it as a skeleton and i haven't created a great skeleton but html is skeleton only. So this is our basic working of website so let's move forward and see what is the role of html. Javascript is its brain that where to go, when to go how to go the way it decides all the things is that great. If it does not exists, suppose you go to restaurant and ask for chinese noodles if he doesn't make chinese noodles how will he feed you?. The skin, skin's colour of the skeleton hair, clothes through which humans look nice And you will never be able to relate how to use all this 3 things if you want to relate and understand things properly then read all the 3 simultaneously and learn by building website that only i am going to teach you through this course so javascript is high level dynamic interpreted programming language and meaning of dynamic i will explain later leave this for now and this is client side scripting language. I will add playlist in description quickly grab that playlist don't forget to like this video that's it for today's video thank you so much for watching this video. You took css and trying to remember every property and took that and never even touched javascript you don't even know what j and s have in javascript. How everything works you don't even know javascript spelling don't do this else you will spend a lot of time. And those who already know will get to know that which are those practices which they should use but weren't using. So here the programming inside browser like clicking on this will give this if i hover mouse then what should happen all this can be written through javascript if i click on any element a new window should open clicking on any element should submit a form all that can be done through javascript. We will learn how to do all this things and here to do your client side scripting javascript helps i hope you have understood the role of html css and javascript in web development.
